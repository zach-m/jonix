He lives in Merseyside with his family. Frank's first book, Millions won the CILIP Carnegie Medal 2004 and was shortlisted for a number of awards including the Guardian Children's Fiction Award 2004. Millions was also been made into a movie directed by Danny Boyle and was chosen as the Liverpool Reads book for September 2005. Framed, was published in September 2005.\r\n\r\nIn his own words: \"Shortly after leaving university, I had a radio play broadcast and it led to a job at Thames Television (Education Department), where I met Michael Winterbottom who was an editor at the time. We planned to make movies. At the time everyone in England had given up on films. It was after the Goldcrest debacle so it was like saying you wanted to do door-to-door roof thatching or scrimshaw work - a lost art. I supported myself by writing for Coronation Street - wonderful fun and the nearest I've ever got to a proper job. Then we made Welcome to Sarajevo and we've made several films since. Other screenplays that I have written include: The Stranger (nominated for a BAFTA) Butterfly Kiss, Welcome to Sarajevo, Hilary and Jackie (also nominated for a BAFTA), Pandemonium, 24 Hour Party People, The Claim, Code 46 and Millions.\r\n\r\nWhen I met my wife-to-be, she was planning on becoming a nun. Luckily I managed to persuade her to marry me instead. We now have 7 children, ranging from two to twenty years old and we live in Liverpool.\r\n \r\nEveryone seems to have had a good English teacher at some point. Mine was Mr Biggs who moonlighted as a Punch and Judy man and managed to persuade me to be his assistant. Throughout my sixth form I spent weekends doing children's parties and parish fetes with him and his dog (the dog used to pass the hat around). After school I took a year off and did it myself. I earned a fortune entirely in small change. Maybe that's where I first got interested in the problems created by user-unfriendly cash!\""}]},{"personName":{"value":"Steven Lenton"},"keyNames":{"value":"Lenton"},"contributorRoles":[{"value":"Illustrated_by"}],"sequenceNumber":{"value":2},"personNameInverted":{"value":"Lenton, Steven"},"namesBeforeKey":{"value":"Steven"}}],"noCollection":{},"noEdition":{},"measures":[{"measureType":{"value":"Height"},"measurement":{"value":208.0},"measureUnitCode":{"value":"Millimeters"}},{"measureType":{"value":"Width"},"measurement":{"value":135.0},"measureUnitCode":{"value":"Millimeters"}},{"measureType":{"value":"Unit_weight"},"measurement":{"value":300.0},"measureUnitCode":{"value":"Grams"}}],"contributorStatements":[{"value":"Frank Cottrell-Boyce, illustrated by Steven Lenton"}],"languages":[{"languageRole":{"value":"Language_of_text"},"languageCode":{"value":"English"}}],"extents":[{"extentType":{"value":"Main_content_page_count"},"extentValue":{"value":320.0},"extentUnit":{"value":"Pages"}}],"subjects":[{"subjectSchemeIdentifier":{"value":"BIC_subject_category"},"subjectCode":{"value":"YFB"},"mainSubject":{},"subjectSchemeVersion":{"value":"2.1"},"subjectHeadingTexts":[{"value":"General fiction (Children's / Teenage)"}]}],"audiences":[{"audienceCodeType":{"value":"ONIX_audience_codes"},"audienceCodeValue":{"value":"02"}}]},"collateralDetail":{"textContents":[{"textType":{"value":"Biographical_note"},"contentAudiences":[{"value":"Unrestricted"}],"texts":[{"value":"Frank Cottrell-Boyce is an award-winning author and screenwriter. &lt;i&gt;Millions&lt;/i&gt;, his debut children's novel, won the CILIP Carnegie Medal.

Why shouldn't a working-class horse take on the high flyers in the rarified world of racing? \r\n\r\nShe bought a mare for £350, paired her up with a pedigree stallion and helped to create a syndicate of twenty-three friends from the village – each paying £10 a week – to raise the resulting foal, Dream Alliance.  He may have grown up on an allotment but Dream Alliance had star quality, beating all the odds to become a winner at a number of world-class racetracks. Then a terrible injury to his leg threatened not just his career but his life.  Refusing to have him put down, the syndicate paid for experimental surgery and Dream Alliance went on to not only make a full recovery but win the Welsh Grand National.\r\n\r\nFunny and charming,

A powerful and haunting tale for teen fans of urban fantasy, fairy tales, and horror who enjoy books by Leigh Bardugo, Kendare Blake, Catherynne Valente, and V. E. Schwab.\r\n \r\nIn Vassa’s gritty Brooklyn neighborhood, where she lives with her stepmother and bickering stepsisters, one might stumble onto magic, but stumbling away again could become an issue. Babs Yagg, the owner of the local convenience store, has a policy of beheading shoplifters—and sometimes innocent shoppers as well. When Vassa’s stepsister sends her out for light bulbs in the middle of night, she knows it could easily become a suicide mission.\r\n \r\n But Vassa has a bit of luck hidden in her pocket, a gift from her dead mother. Erg is a tough-talking wooden doll with sticky fingers, a bottomless stomach, and a ferocious cunning. With Erg’s help, Vassa just might be able to break the witch’s curse and free her Brooklyn neighborhood. But Babs won’t be playing fair....\r\n \r\n Inspired by the Russian folktale \"Vassilissa the Beautiful\" and Sarah Porter's years of experience teaching creative writing to New York City students, &lt;i&gt;Vassa in the Night&lt;/i&gt; weaves a dark yet hopeful tale about a young girl’s search for home, love, and

That is, until his mother is murdered, and he’s sent halfway across the world in a mission to overthrow the queen who killed her. Athan’s task is to ingratiate himself, undercover, with the royal children—and gain intel that could ruin their mother. Kind and quick-witted Princess Aurelia Isendare is not the villain he expects, however, and he soon finds himself falling for the girl he’s been tasked with spying upon. Aurelia feels the same attraction to Athan, all the while seeking to stop the war threatening to break. As diplomatic ties between their nations manage to just barely hold, the two teens struggle to remain loyal to their families and each other as they learn that war is not as black and white as they’ve

Told from the perspectives of 16-year-olds Sibylla and Lou as they spend  a term in the wilderness with their classmates, the story follows a  group of typical teenagers trying to find their place in a world that  has changed greatly since their parents were the same age. While both  narrators are likeable, Fiona Wood's great triumph is the voice of Lou,  who we first met in Six Impossible Things. She is the new girl  at school, observant, witty, self-possessed and still reeling from the  death of her boyfriend the previous year. Sibylla, in contrast, is  struggling with more common teenage dramas, including boyfriends, old  friends and new friends. Through Lou's eyes, and a class assignment on Othello,  we are granted a window into the blossoming relationship and subsequent  betrayal of Sibylla by those she thought most likely to look out for  her. This is perfect for fans of John Green, with just the right blend  of emotional heft and humour. I would highly recommend it for readers  aged 14 and up.\r\n Amelia Lush is the children's buyer at Better Read Than Dead in Newtown.  &lt;i&gt;This review first appeared in the Junior Term 2 2013 supplement of&lt;/i&gt; Books+Publishing magazine&lt;i&gt;.

They didn't always agree, but there was a mutual respect. It is very different now. \r\n\r\nStarting with the celebrated TV fight between Ken Russell and Alexander Walker (the former hit the latter with a rolled up copy of his &lt;i&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/i&gt; review!) and ending with his own admission to Steven Spielberg of a major error of judgement, Mark Kermode takes us on a journey across the modern cinematic landscape. We are all critics now and, as the professional role diminishes, the democratic opportunities of the internet have created a new monster. Relying on speed of response, rather than considered reaction, these new critics have stolen the thunder of their paid up counterparts. But there is a dark side, the shocking deceptions hidden behind the facade of our digital world's new and supposedly democratic alternative, \"the honest, unmediated audience response\". Mark questions the future of any and all genuinely impartial criticism when reviews are systemically corrupted by bribery, vote-rigging, cyber-stalking, and sock-puppetry.
