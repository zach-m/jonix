/**
 * <h1>Product composite</h1>
 * <p>
 * A product is described by a group of data elements beginning with an XML label &lt;Product&gt; and ending with an XML
 * label &lt;/Product&gt;. The entire group of data elements which is enclosed between these two labels constitutes an
 * ONIX product record. The product record is the fundamental unit within an ONIX Product Information message. In almost
 * every case, each product record describes an individually tradable item; and in all circumstances, each tradable item
 * identified by a recognized product identifier should be described by one, and only one, ONIX product record.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In ONIX&nbsp;3.0, a &lt;Product&gt; record has a mandatory ‘preamble’ comprising data Groups P.1 and P.2, and
 * carrying data that identifies the record and the product to which it refers. This is followed by up to seven
 * ‘blocks’, each optional, some of which are repeatable.
 * </p>
 * <table border='1' cellpadding='3'>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Reference name</td>
 * <td><tt>&lt;Product&gt;</tt></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Short tag</td>
 * <td><tt>&lt;product&gt;</tt></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Cardinality</td>
 * <td>0&#8230;n</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p/>
 * Technical notes about &lt;Product&gt; from the schema author:
 *
 * Container for details of a single product &#9679; Added &lt;ProductionDetail&gt; (Block 8) at revision 3.0.8 &#9679;
 * Added &lt;PromotionDetail&gt; (Block 7) at revision 3.0.7 &#9679; Modified cardinality of &lt;DeletionText&gt; at
 * revision 3.0.1
 *
 * This tag may be included in the following composites:
 * <ul>
 * <li>&lt;{@link ONIXMessage}&gt;</li>
 * </ul>
 * Possible placements within ONIX message:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Product}</li>
