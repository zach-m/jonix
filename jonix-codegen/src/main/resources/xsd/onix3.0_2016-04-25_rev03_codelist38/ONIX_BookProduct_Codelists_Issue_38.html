		<h1>ONIX for Books</h1>
		<h1 class="subhead">Codelists Issue 38</h1>
		<p>14 July 2017</p>
		<p>DOI: <a href="http://doi.org/10.4400/akjh" rel="external" target="_blank">10.4400/akjh</a></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.editeur.org/files/ONIX%20for%20books%20-%20code%20lists/ONIX_BookProduct_Codelists_Current.html">Go to latest Issue</a></p>
		<p>All ONIX standards and documentation – including this document – are copyright materials, made available free of charge for general use. A full license agreement (DOI: <a href="http://doi.org/10.4400/nwgj" rel="external" target="_blank">10.4400/nwgj</a>) that governs their use is available on the EDItEUR website.</p>
		<p><strong>All ONIX users should note that this is the second issue of the ONIX codelists that does not include support for codelists used <em>only</em> with ONIX version 2.1.</strong> Of course, ONIX 2.1 remains fully usable, using Issue 36 of the codelists or earlier. Issue 36 continues to be available via the archive section of the EDItEUR website (http://www.editeur.org/15/Archived-Previous-Releases).</p>
		<p>Codelists are revised quarterly.</p>
		<h3>Layout of codelists</h3>
		<p>This document contains ONIX for Books codelists Issue 38, intended primarily for use with ONIX 3.0. They may also be used as controlled vocabularies, independent of ONIX. The codelists are arranged in a single table for reference and printing.</p>
		<p>This document does not differentiate explicitly between codelists for ONIX 3.0 and those that are used with earlier releases, but lists used <em>only</em> with earlier releases have been removed. For details of which code list to use with which data element in each version of ONIX, please consult the main <cite>Specification</cite> for the appropriate release. Occasionally, a handful of codes within a particular list are defined as either deprecated, or not valid for use in a particular version of ONIX or with a particular data element. While these limitations are not fully validated using the accompanying XML schemas, they may be rejected by enhanced validation in the future.</p>
		<p>The complete set of code list entries is also available in comma-separated, tab-separated, JSON and XML formats, as well as in multiple HTML files, and as XSD, RNG or DTD files integrated into the relevant schemas.</p>
		<h4>Codelist headers</h4>
		<p>These are laid out with three columns:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Codelist number</li>
			<li>List name</li>
			<li>The number of the Codelist Issue in which the list was added. Zero for all lists which were added before Issue 1, and for any lists for which values have not yet been assigned.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Codelist entries</h4>
		<p>These are laid out in five columns:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Code value used in ONIX message data</li>
			<li>Code label, often used for display of coded data</li>
			<li>Notes on the meaning and usage of the code value</li>
			<li>The number of the Codelist Issue in which the entry was first added. Zero for all codes which were added before Issue 1</li>
			<li>The number of the Codelist Issue in which the description or notes were most recently revised, and blank for entries that have never needed revision</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Color coding</h4>
		<p>Text in <span style="color: blue">blue</span> highlights revised descriptions or notes in this issue. Text in <span style="color: red">red</span> highlights new entries in this Issue.</p>

A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ usually but not always means that the publisher has decided to sell off excess inventory of the book. Copies of books that are remaindered are often made available in the supply chain at a reduced price. However, such remainders are often sold under a product identifier that differs from the ISBN on the full-priced copy of the book. A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ on a given product record may or may not be followed by a Publishing Status code 06 ‘Out of Stock Indefinitely’ or 07 ‘Out of Print’: the practise varies from one publisher to another. Some publishers may revert to a Publishing Status code 04 ‘Active’ if a desired inventory level on the product in question has subsequently been reached.
